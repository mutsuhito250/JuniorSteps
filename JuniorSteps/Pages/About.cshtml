                        I'm Mahammad Ismayilov, a junior software developer with a strong foundation in C#, .NET, and modern web technologies.
                        I recently completed a full-stack development bootcamp and am currently looking for internship or junior-level opportunities in software or IT.
                        I enjoy building practical applications, writing clean code, and learning new tools every day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I also like sharing what I learn through personal blog posts and small projects.
